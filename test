Yes, you can create another Web Worker inside your `Session` class and use Comlink to communicate with it. Create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `unzipWorker.js`) containing the unzipping logic and expose it using Comlink. Then, within the `Session` class, create a new instance of this worker and use Comlink to asynchronously handle the unzipping process.

Here's a basic outline:

1. Create `unzipWorker.js`:
```javascript
import * as Comlink from 'comlink';

class UnzipWorker {
  async unzip(zipFile) {
    // unzip logic using zipFile
  }
}

Comlink.expose(UnzipWorker);
```

2. Inside your `Session` class:
```javascript
import * as Comlink from 'comlink';
import UnzipWorker from './unzipWorker.js';

class Session {
  async fetchAndUnzip(zipURL) {
    const response = await fetch(zipURL);
    const zipFile = await response.blob();

    const worker = new Worker(new URL('./unzipWorker.js', import.meta.url));
    const UnzipProxy = Comlink.wrap(worker);
    const unzipWorkerInstance = await new UnzipProxy();
    
    const result = await unzipWorkerInstance.unzip(zipFile);

    // use result as needed

    worker.terminate();
  }
}
```

Now, whenever you need to fetch and unzip large files, the `fetchAndUnzip` method in `Session` will run it in a separate worker, which will prevent the UI from freezing.
